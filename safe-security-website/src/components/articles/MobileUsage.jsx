<Body>Have a phone? Anyone with a phone - iPhone or Android - can be at risk for attacks.</Body>
<Body>A phone is basically a mini computer that you carry with you everywhere; it contains a lot of important information about you. Mobile banking access, emails, photos, Apple or Google pay, your contact information, friends and family contact information, social media accounts, all other apps (Grubhub),work accounts, etc. are all examples of information that you wouldn’t want anyone else to know! Access to this kind of information makes your money, identity, behavior patterns, friends/family information accessible to criminals.</Body>
<Body>But this doesn’t mean you should just stop using your phone! You can secure your phone and information in a few simple steps!</Body>

<Section>How to Use This Guide</Section>
<Body>We recommend all readers read the bolded advice from each section - being as secure as possible certainly doesn’t hurt!</Body>
<Body>However, we also know that all advice does not apply to everyone so we’ve split this guide into sections. Make sure to read the sections that apply to you and feel free to read anything else! Our goal is to help you.</Body>
<Section>Mobile App Security and Privacy</Section>
<Body>Do you have Angry Birds installed on your phone? TikTok? Candy Crush?</Body>
<Body>There are so many apps out there that we install to keep ourselves entertained, stay connected with the world, and manage our lives. Many of them are great and safe to use, but some might not be as safe.</Body>
<Body>Let’s explore how to keep ourselves safe before and after downloading an app.</Body>
<Section>Heard of The App Store? Use It.</Section>
<Body>The official app store–for Apple iPhones it’s App Store and Android phones it’s Google Play–is automatically installed on your phone when you buy it. Why? It’s a trustworthy source and here’s why:</Body>
<BulletItem>Apps submitted to the app store are <strong>reviewed and approved by a professional</strong>. This means someone physically downloaded the app to test it, making sure there weren’t any bugs or errors. More importantly, they checked that the app had no malicious behavior. These professionals also check that apps follow app store guidelines.</BulletItem>   
<BulletItem>Apps in the app store must <strong>adhere to certain guidelines that help protect your safety</strong>. Some of these guidelines are legal requirements such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which is designed to protect personal data linked to individuals in the EU, or the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) which imposes certain requirements on operators of websites/services directed to US children under 13 years old. Some of these guidelines are also self-imposed by the manufacturers. For instance, Apple requires all apps in their App Store to have privacy policies.</BulletItem>
<Body>So now that we’ve established why we should be using the app store, let’s understand how it works.</Body>
<Body>On Apple’s App Store, there are 5 main sections:App preview, Ratings and reviews, Latest version,Privacy, and Miscellaneous information.</Body>
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/phaRW0f.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '400px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br> 
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

    </div>
<br></br> 
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8V9IfXB.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '400px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br> 
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/26AWPi4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '400px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br>
<Body>The above pictures show what appears before you download Pokemon Go on an iPhone. Google Play for Android includes similar sections including app preview, ratings and reviews, latest version, data safety, and miscellaneous information.</Body>
<Body>Let’s break down the privacy section on the App Store:</Body>
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/26AWPi4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '400px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br>
<Body>There are 4 main sections:</Body>
    <LabeledItem label="1">Privacy policy</LabeledItem>
    <LabeledItem label="2">Data used to track you</LabeledItem>
    <LabeledItem label="3">Data linked to you</LabeledItem>
    <LabeledItem label="4">Data not linked to you</LabeledItem>
<SubSection>Do I Bother Reading Privacy Policies? Care About These 3 Things.</SubSection>
<Body>It’s a well-accepted fact that the average person does not read privacy policies. Let’s face it - they’re disgustingly long and boring.</Body>
<Body>You’re not wrong here. If we take a look at this infographic created by TechCrunch, it was found that <strong>the average privacy policy takes 10 minutes to read</strong> - that’s 2,464 words.</Body>
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/t4Zy6SE.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '650px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br>
<Body>It’s not just that privacy policies are super long, but they’re also notoriously difficult to read. The average privacy policy is at a college sophomore’s reading level whereas the average reading level in the U.S. is only at 8th grade.</Body>
<Body>If they’re so difficult and time consuming to read, why should we even bother?</Body>
<Body>Well, you know when you pretend to read the terms and conditions and just check the box so you can get to using that app already? When you click these:</Body>
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/grgcQMA.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '400px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br>
<Body><strong>You are legally agreeing to data collection/use data however described in the privacy policy​.</strong></Body>
<Body>We’re with you - we also don’t want to waste 10 minutes reading something we don’t understand. Instead, what you can do is spend 30 seconds looking for these 3 red flags.</Body>
<SubSubSection>DO NOT Download The App If The Privacy Policy Includes Any Of These 3 Red Flags:</SubSubSection>
<LabeledItem label="1"><strong>NOT</strong> updated within the last year</LabeledItem>
<LabeledItem label="2">Does <strong>NOT</strong> allow you to delete accounts (check using ctrl+F “delete” or “erase”)</LabeledItem>
<LabeledItem label="3"><strong>NO</strong> contact information (check using ctrl+F “contact”)</LabeledItem>
<SubSection>How Do I Know What Data an App Collects From Me?</SubSection>
<Body>First, let’s understand what types of data an app can collect.</Body>
<Body>If we take this section from TikTok’s information on the Apple App Store, contact information and identifiers are fairly vague descriptions:</Body>
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rVxTf8D.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '650px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br>
<Body>However, Apple has documentation that breaks these descriptors down. Contact information actually includes name, email address, phone number, physical address, and other. Identifiers include user ID and device ID.</Body>
<Body>You probably didn’t know that contact information actually meant 5+ different pieces of information, so spend the extra 30 seconds looking up what data the app is collecting.</Body>
<SubSubSection>Understand The Data.</SubSubSection>
<LabeledItem label="1">For Apple users: <Hyperlink href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#user-tracking" text="check out here"/></LabeledItem>
<LabeledItem label="2">For Android users: <Hyperlink href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469?hl=en#zippy=%2Cdata-types.” text=”check out here"/></LabeledItem>
<Body>So now we understand what an app is collecting, the next step is to understand how they are using the collected data.</Body>
<Body>On the App Store, Apple splits up data usage into 3 categories: data used to track you, data linked to you, and data not linked to you. Let’s talk about the difference between these categories.</Body>
<SubSubSection>What Is Data Used To Track You?</SubSubSection>
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aoIJH79.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '350px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br>
<Body>Think <strong>third parties and targeted advertisements.</strong> Data used to track you includes data that is shared across different apps, ad networks, and companies. Note that these are across apps and websites owned by <strong>other</strong> companies.</Body>
<Body>Let’s say it’s the holiday season and your company is about to host its annual holiday party. You start browsing on Google for some formal wear to impress your coworkers, and then later get an ad for an outfit you were looking at on Subway Surfers. How did that happen? This is an example of data used to track you. It happens all the time for instance:</Body> 
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uoImZOc.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '650px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br>
<Body>So what should you do about this? Only download the app if you can answer yes to the following:</Body>
<SubSubSection>Am I Comfortable With Any Company Knowing This About Me?</SubSubSection>
<SubSubSection>What Is Data Linked To You?</SubSubSection>
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Rix4mw9.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '350px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br>
<Body>Data linked to you includes data that is collected by the app and linked to you, but not shared with other companies. It’s basically the data this particular company uses to create your identity.</Body>
<Body>So what should you do about this? Only download the app if you can answer yes to the following:</Body>
<SubSubSection>Am I Comfortable With This Company Identifying Me With This?</SubSubSection>
<SubSubSection>What Is Data Not Linked To You?</SubSubSection>
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bkMEbtg.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '350px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br>
<Body>Data not linked to you includes data that the company generally aggregates into larger statistics. It is not linked to your identity. This category often includes usage data which companies aggregate to understand how people are using their app.</Body>
<SubSubSection>Make sure nothing in this category is specific to your identity. If you can identify yourself using just the data in this category, do not download the app.</SubSubSection>
<Section>Let’s Talk About Dangerous Apps</Section>
<SubSubSection>Never Download Apps From a Website.</SubSubSection>
<Body>Why? The main reason is to avoid bad apps. When we say a bad app, we are talking about what is professionally dubbed a <strong>Potentially Harmful App (PHA).</strong> A PHA is an app that can put you, your data, or your phone at risk. In other words, there are malicious intentions behind this app which can include collecting your private information without consent, charging you money in intentionally deceiving ways, or even taking control of your phone.</Body>
<Body>A Potentially Harmful App is a harmful app, so what’s with the “potentially”? Simply put, it just depends on your phone. A PHA can be potentially harmful for one phone but not another because malicious apps function differently depending on a variety of variables. For example, a shiny iPhone 14 Pro might not be affected by EvilAppHehe which uses a deprecated service to perform malicious behavior, but an iPhone 7 which is running an ancient, outdated version might be at risk.</Body>
<Body><strong>This is why you should always update your phone’s software.</strong></Body>
<SubSection>How Can I Steer Clear of Dangerous Apps?</SubSection>
<Body>So how can you avoid a PHA? The simple answer is to <strong>only download apps from the app store.</strong></Body>
<Body>Before you click download on the app store, make sure you read the reviews as well.</Body>
<SubSubSection>Spare 5 Seconds And Read The Top Three Reviews.</SubSubSection>
<Body>While the app store is a trustworthy source, this does not guarantee that apps on there are 100% safe and risk free. It’s possible that the reviewer missed something as small as a malicious line of code, so always check what other people say about the app. If the app is “sketchy” or glitchy, you’ll immediately know from the comments.</Body>
<Section>Got Any Apps? Follow These 5 Tips To Secure Them.</Section>
<Body>Venmo? Uber? Chrome? TikTok? Facebook? Instagram? Grubhub? Candy Crush? Subway Surfers? Surely you’ve got at least one app installed on your phone.</Body>
<Body>We’re going to step through 5 general tips to secure already installed apps:</Body>
	<LabeledItem label="1">Review app permissions</LabeledItem>
    <LabeledItem label="2">Limit location permissions</LabeledItem>
    <LabeledItem label="3">Limit integrating external accounts</LabeledItem>
    <LabeledItem label="4">Delete unused apps</LabeledItem>
    <LabeledItem label="5">Update app software</LabeledItem>
<SubSection>Can I allow Chrome to access all of my photos, camera, microphone, etc?</SubSection>
<Body>The short is <strong>no.</strong> Don’t give Chrome or any other app automatic access to these permissions if it’s not necessary.</Body>
<SubSection>Remove unnecessary permissions. Choose the least invasive option possible.</SubSection>
<Body>For instance, there is a toggle that allows Chrome to always have access to your camera versus asking for permission when a website requests it. The least invasive option is to have conditional permission as opposed to unrestricted permission. The camera permission should be toggled off as shown in the picture below.</Body>
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZXVEEW0.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '350px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br>
<Body>As shown in the image above, another permission that should be monitored is the one that grants access to photos. Chrome should only have access to a select few photos which are given by the Add Photos Only permission. The least invasive option here is to <strong>limit what photos Chrome has access to</strong>–by manual selection–as opposed to giving Chrome access to your entire camera roll. Another way to frame this is to ask yourself: Does Chrome really need access to my family portrait, that mirror selfie, or evidence someone stole a bite of your food? Only choose the option that you can confidently answer yes to - yes, this app needs this permission setting at any point in time.</Body>
<Body>So how do you do this?</Body>
<BulletItem>Go to Settings - Scroll to your app</BulletItem>
<Body>And just go down the list! Yes, you do need to manually go through each of your apps. While it might take a good 20 minutes to review, the payoff is worth it.</Body>
<Body>Pay special attention to <strong>contact list, camera, storage, location, and microphone permissions.</strong> These are particularly private permissions that can reveal a lot about one’s identity.</Body>
<SubSection>Can I allow Google to always access my location?</SubSection>
<Body>This time, the definitive answer is <strong>no.</strong> Don’t give Google or any other app persistent location permission. Why? Because it’s <strong>not necessary.</strong></Body>
<Body>Hopefully you haven’t already forgotten the first piece of advice given above: choose the least invasive option possible.</Body>
<SubSection>Set location access to “While Using” or less</SubSection>
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PpF222A.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '350px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br>
<Body>This means Never, Ask Next Time Or When I Share, and While Using the App are all ok. Never would of course be the least invasive option, but if you’re going to end up Googling “Restaurants near me” or “Target hours”, it makes sense to give Google conditional access to your location with the Ask Next Time permission when you ask a location-based question.</Body>
<Body>Regardless, <strong>never choose always.</strong> This would be voluntarily giving every website you visit your location.</Body>
<Body>To change your location settings:</Body>
<BulletItem>Go to Settings - Privacy and Security - Location Services</BulletItem>
<Body>And just go down the list! This should only take about 3 minutes.</Body>
<SubSection>I just downloaded an app. Should I sign in with my Google or other existing account?</SubSection>
<Body>The general answer is <strong>no.</strong> You’ve probably seen a screen like the one below where you’re given an option to create a new account or link it to an existing one - something like Continue with Google or Continue with Apple.</Body>
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jvXs8xW.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '350px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br>
<Body>In the above scenario, you should not continue with Twitter by linking your Google or Apple account. Why? The two will <strong>share information with each other.</strong> If you use Twitter with your Google account, Twitter would know all of your Google data (e.g. browsing history) and Google would know all of your Twitter data (e.g. who you follow). We want to minimize what one company knows about you, so keep them separate.</Body>
<Body>There is however one caveat.</Body>
<Body><strong>Only link existing accounts if the two are similar.</strong></Body>
<Body>According to a study published by NordPass in 2020, <strong>the average person has 100 passwords.</strong> That’s crazy! And also impossible to memorize. Let’s be real, this is why you reuse passwords all the time, right?</Body>
<Body>Password reuse is risky in the unfortunate event it gets cracked and suddenly an attacker gets access to the 20 other apps/websites you use it for. Thus, it can save yourself the effort of memorizing a new password when you do link accounts. If the account you’re linking to is similar–meaning it probably has the same data on you as this new app would collect–then it’s actually a smart idea to link the two accounts.</Body>
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Wu9Rq1B.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '350px', height: 'auto' }}/>
    </div>
<br></br>
<Body>In the above case with Instagram and Facebook, linking is a good idea since the two will have similar information on you.</Body>
<SubSection>Forgot you had an app downloaded? Delete it.</SubSection>
<Body>This one’s pretty straightforward. The general rule of thumb:</Body>
<SubSubSection>If it’s been over 3 months since you last used an app, delete it.</SubSubSection>
<Body>If you aren’t using it, the app is just taking up storage space and opens you up to possible vulnerabilities.</Body>
<br></br>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Wu9Rq1B.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '350px', height: 'auto' }}/>
