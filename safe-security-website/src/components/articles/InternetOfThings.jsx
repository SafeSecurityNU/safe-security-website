            <Section>What is an Internet of Things (IoT) device?</Section>
            <Body>An IOT device is a regular everyday object that has a computer embedded into it to make it "smart." For example:</Body>
            <Header>Lightbulb</Header>
                <Body>Computer capabilities added: Wireless communication</Body>
                <Body>Resulting IoT device: Smart bulb controllable from your phone</Body>
            <Header>Door Lock</Header>
                <Body><strong>Computer capabilities added:</strong> Motion sensing + wireless communication</Body>
                <Body><strong>Resulting IoT device:</strong> Smart home alarm system</Body>
            <Header>Speaker</Header>
                <Body><strong>Computer capabilities added:</strong> Voice recognition + wireless communication</Body>
                <Body><strong>Resulting IoT device:</strong> Smart home assistant (e.g. Alexa, Google Home)</Body>
            <Body>However, this ecosystem really should be called the "Internet of Insecure Things." There are many avenues to exploit IoT devices, and in this document, you will learn about some of them, as well as how to protect yourself.</Body>
            <Section>Ensuring security: How to avoid being a hacker's target</Section>
            <Body>In this section, we'll discuss strategies to minimize the risk of being hacked, or having someone take over your device illegally and with malicious intentions.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>Whom does this apply to?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>If you are able to control your home IoT devices (lights, microwaves, etc.) from outside your house, this section applies to you.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>What is happening?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>Just as burglars walk through neighborhoods to look for houses that look like they might be easy targets (doors left unlocked, windows left open, etc.), hackers also regularly scan the Internet for easy targets. If you can control your devices from outside your home, then attackers can also see your devices as they scan the Internet.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>Why is this a problem?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>When burglars see a house that is frequently left unlocked, they note down the address so that they can break into it at a later time. Similarly, once hackers see your devices on the Internet, they note it as a potential target. A good way to avoid being attacked by hackers is to not appear on their list at all.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>How do I fix this?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>Set your IoT device to be only accessible when you're sharing its local network (i.e., when you're at home). We have an example below, and the exact steps will differ by device, but look for a setting that allows you to turn on local area network (LAN) control. Pictured below are ways to do this from various smart apps.</Body>

            <SubSection>How to prevent default password attacks</SubSection>
            <SubSubSection>Whom does this apply to?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>If you are not 100% sure that you have changed the default passwords on your IoT devices or network router, this section applies to you.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>What is happening?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>Most IoT devices and network routers have a set of default credentials that come with them so you can log into the device for the first time. Those credentials are often available on the Internet, either on manufacturer help pages or in owner's manuals. However, most IoT devices use very insecure default password combinations. Some example default usernames and passwords include: support/support, admin/admin, admin/0000, user/user, or root/12345.. If you do not change your default username and password, then the login information for your device is publicly accessible on the web for anyone to use. Pictured below are default usernames and passwords used by a Philips router.</Body>
            <br></br>
            <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kNaxs7D.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '650px', height: 'auto' }}/>
            </div>
            <br></br>
            <SubSubSection>Why is this a problem?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>In 2016, a hacker organization created something called the Mirai Botnetâ€“basically, a large collection of devices that they could control. First, they searched the Internet for accessible devices. Then, they gathered a list of the 62 most common default usernames and passwords and tried to access all the devices they found. By September 20, 2016, they had <Hyperlink href="https://www.asmag.com/showpost/26498.aspx" text="150,000 devices" /> under their control, using only those 62 sets of credentials. Think of default credentials as a master key to every house in a neighborhood. By leaving default credentials on the device, you're doing the computer-equivalent of not changing your locks. If the master key is floating around on the Internet, it's essentially the same as not having a lock on your door at all.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>How do I fix this?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>Make sure you change your default credentials. Most IoT devices have a "settings" menu on their mobile app, and within that "settings" menu should be a profile option or a security menu. You should be able to navigate from there to a page to change your password. When changing your password, remember to keep in mind good password design: avoid using any complete common words or phrases you share on social media; use a mix of capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols; and make your passwords longer than 12 characters. All of these measures will dramatically increase the amount of time it takes a hacker to "crack" (or, guess) your password.</Body>

            <SubSection>How to prevent hackers from infiltrating your IoT devices</SubSection>
            <SubSubSection>Whom does this apply to?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>If your IoT devices are running outdated firmware, or you are not sure when the last time you updated your IoT firmware is, this section applies to you.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>What is happening?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>You've changed your passwords, so the hackers can't just log in to your devices, which is great! Unfortunately, just as burglars don't need the key to break into your house, hackers are also able to hack your devices without knowing the password.</Body>
            <Body>Bugs in the firmware of your devices can sometimes allow hackers to <Hyperlink href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/iot-threat-report-2020/" text="gain unauthorized access into the device."/>. When these bugs are found, companies usually release software updates to fix them. However, if you are running an old version with the bug, the hacker can use the bug to gain access to your device.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>Why is this a problem?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>Once a hacker is in your device, they can install malware, which lets them run code to do more harmful things (explained in sections below).</Body>
            <Body>Here are some video examples of simple things that hackers can do after they have infiltrated your devices:</Body>
            <SubSubSection>How do I fix this?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>Always update the software and firmware on your devices when prompted, and check for updates periodically if you are not prompted.</Body>
            <SubSection>How to avoid information theft</SubSection>
            <SubSubSection>Whom does this apply to?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>If you use the same login information on your IoT devices as you do on other accounts, or if your IoT devices collect any personal information about you (home information, car information, medical information, etc.), then this section applies to you.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>What is happening?</SubSubSection>
            <Body><Hyperlink href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-iot-security" text="98% of IoT network traffic is unencrypted"/>. This means that anything your IoT device sends or receives (including any interaction between your phone and the device itself) is readable in plain English to anyone who might be watching (and it is free and easy to watch network traffic with basic tools like <Hyperlink href="https://www.wireshark.org/" text="Wireshark"/>. This traffic often includes login credentials, information about the device, and information gathered by the device.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>Why is this a problem?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>Any data that has been sent to or received from your IoT device can be easily acquired by hackers. For some concrete examples, hackers might be able to get an interior floor plan of your house from your Roomba, view the status of your smart alarm or door locks, see information gathered by medical IoT devices such as heart monitors, or even view information on your car from a smart car charger like one from Tesla. That information can be leveraged to compromise your personal security or sold to companies that gather personal data for marketing.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>How do I fix this?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>This isn't really one way to remove the risk entirely, but you can definitely take action to minimize harm. First, make sure you are not recycling your IoT passwords on any other accounts. If your Gmail has the same password as your smart lights, and an attacker sees your login credentials for your lights, they can now log into your Gmail. Also, avoid using any IoT devices that gather or require extremely personal data, except when required for medical reasons. Smart alarms and door locks are examples of devices that should be avoided. Similarly, be wary of any IoT devices that include location tracking.</Body>
            <SubSection>How to prevent hackers from controlling your devices</SubSection>
            <SubSubSection>Whom does this apply to?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>If any of the previous sections have applied to you, this one does, too.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>What is happening?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>If attackers can access or infiltrate your device, then the chances are good that they can also remotely control your device by logging in remotely, exploiting software bugs, or other methods. First, an attacker will use an initial vulnerability to open a "backdoor" on your device, which is an easy way for them to connect to it. After opening that backdoor, they can send malicious code to your device to make it follow their commands instead of yours.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>Why is this a problem?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>If attackers can get a backdoor onto your device, they can make it do whatever they want. They can turn alarm systems on and off, turn on vacuums, raise your power bill, and probably commit several forms of property damage. A common target for this kind of attack are medical devices; <Hyperlink href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/iot-threat-report-2020/" text="up to 51% of threats against healthcare organizations"/> involve compromised medical imaging devices.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>How do I fix this?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>If you think someone has gotten into your IoT device, you have several options. First, try to factory reset the device. This process looks different for every device, and you may need to consult the manufacturer's guide on how to do it for yours. This will simply reset the device to its original state; you'll have to reconfigure your username and password, and then you're good to go. You can also try resetting passwords and updating firmware and software. If all of this fails, you may need to replace your device.</Body>
            <SubSection>How to prevent hackers from getting into your other devices (including laptops and phones)</SubSection>
            <SubSubSection>Whom does this apply to?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>If your IoT devices are running on the same WiFi network as the rest of your personal devices, such as laptops and phones, then this section applies to you.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>What is happening?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>A hacker can go from controlling your IoT devices to controlling your phones/laptops/other devices.</Body>
            <Body>We can think of devices that share the same WiFi network as being in the same "cyberspace." Just as it is pretty easy to move between two places in the same physical space (from your kitchen to your living room, for example), it is relatively easy for a hacker to move from your IoT device to your personal device if they are in the same "cyberspace.". This technique is known as lateral movement.</Body>
            <br></br>
            <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/brq6CN4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '650px', height: 'auto' }}/>
            </div>
            <br></br>
            <SubSubSection>Why is this a problem?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>A hacker who has access to your personal devices might gain access to even more sensitive information, such as your bank details (if you use internet banking), and can cause even more harm to you.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>How do I fix this?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>Isolate your IoT devices to their own WiFi network.</Body>
            <Body>We have an example from the Xfinity WiFi controller app. You will want to look for a similar setting, and turn <strong>on</strong> the split bands settings.</Body>
            <br></br>
            <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PaXaptF.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '500px', height: 'auto' }}/>
            </div>
            <br></br>
            <Body>You will notice that this involves changing a setting which is marked as "not recommended". Indeed, this step requires a certain amount of technical expertise. If you are not comfortable with this step, we urge you to weigh the pros and cons, and consider if you really want to set up an IoT system.</Body>
            <SubSection>How to avoid becoming a zombie</SubSection>
            <SubSubSection>Whom does this apply to?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>If the section on hackers controlling your devices applies to you, this one does, too.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>What is happening?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>At this point, you need to stop thinking of your IoT device in terms of what it does and start thinking of it as a resource. An IoT device has computing power (by definition; see the introductory section above!), power, and network connectivity. Hackers can write code to control hundreds or thousands of IoT devices at once and use them as one giant computer, sort of like a hive mind. You specifically aren't a target in this kind of attack; your device's power and computing resources are being stolen to help a hacker achieve a bigger end goal.</Body>
            <br></br>
            <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZkXBlfK.png" alt="" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '650px', height: 'auto' }}/>
            </div>
            <br></br>
            <SubSubSection>Why is this a problem?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>For you, this may look like your device being "bricked"; that is, your device can slow down or stop working, because all of its computing and power resources are being diverted to whatever a hacker wants. But what can a hacker do with all of these devices? A common application is mining cryptocurrency; with thousands of small devices, a hacker can create a pretty sizable mining operation equivalent to a few big computers. Hackers can also use IoT devices to execute distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, where thousands of devices flood a service like a website or application with traffic and cause it to shut down. Finally, hackers can also utilize the electrical power of your devices. Remember the year that Texas got snow and it overloaded the power grid? Imagine if a hacker had control of 500 Nest home systems in Dallas and decided to turn everyone's heat on to the max at once. That could cause a catastrophic power failure. This is called a MaDIoT (Manipulation of Demand via IoT) attack.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>How do I fix this?</SubSubSection>
            <Body>Since this is only a small extension on how an attacker can control your device, the strategies for fixing it are the same as in that section. Start with a factory reset, updating software, and changing passwords; and if necessary, seek professional help or replace the device.</Body>
            <Section>Ensuring Privacy: Protecting your personal data in the Age of IoT</Section>
            <Body>In the last section, we assumed the existence of some hacker acting illegally and with bad intentions. In this section, we'll discuss a different kind of compromise: how companies can use your data in completely legal ways that can still compromise your privacy.</Body>
            <SubSection>Protecting Your Personal Data in the Age of IoT: Best Practices for Privacy</SubSection>
            <Body>The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way we interact with technology. From smart home devices to wearable fitness trackers, IoT devices have become ubiquitous in our daily lives. However, with this increased connectivity comes potential risks to personal data security and privacy. As more devices become connected to the Internet, they also become vulnerable to cyber attacks and data breaches. In recent years, there have been several high-profile incidents where IoT devices were hacked, leading to compromised personal information and even physical harm. As such, it is crucial for users to take steps to protect their personal data when using IoT devices. In this paper, we will explore several best practices for keeping our IoT devices and personal information safe. We will discuss the importance of end-to-end encryption and local data storage, using virtual private networks (VPNs) for remote access, reading privacy policies carefully before purchasing and using IoT devices, disabling unnecessary features on IoT devices, looking for IoT privacy policies that explain how collected data will be shared with third parties and what measures are in place to prevent data breaches, and purchasing privacy-focused IoT devices. By following these recommendations outlined in this paper, users can enjoy the benefits of IoT technology while maintaining their privacy and security.</Body>
            <SubSection>Understanding the Risks and Vulnerabilities of IoT Devices</SubSection>
            <Body>The first step in protecting your personal data when using IoT devices is to understand the potential risks and vulnerabilities. While these devices offer convenience and innovation, they also pose significant risks to personal data and privacy. One of the main concerns is the lack of security measures implemented by manufacturers, which can leave devices vulnerable to cyber attacks and data breaches. Additionally, many IoT devices collect sensitive personal data, such as location, biometric data, and behavioral patterns, without clear consent or disclosure. This can lead to the misuse or exploitation of personal information, as well as potential violations of privacy rights. It is important for individuals to research and carefully consider the privacy policies and security measures of IoT devices before purchasing them, and for companies to prioritize user privacy and security in their product design and development.</Body>
            <SubSection>Choosing Privacy-Focused IoT Devices</SubSection>
            <Body>One of the most important steps in protecting your personal data when using IoT devices is to choose devices that prioritize privacy and security. Look for devices that use end-to-end encryption, which ensures that data is encrypted at all stages of transmission and storage. Additionally, consider devices that store data locally rather than in the cloud, as this can reduce the risk of data breaches. When purchasing IoT devices, read the privacy policy carefully to understand how your data will be collected, used, and shared. Look for policies that are transparent about data collection and sharing practices, and avoid devices with vague or overly broad policies. Finally, consider purchasing privacy-focused IoT devices from companies that prioritize user privacy and security. By taking these steps, you can help to ensure that your personal data remains safe and secure when using IoT devices. Now that we've covered some important steps to take when choosing privacy-focused IoT devices, let's take a closer look at some specific devices that prioritize privacy and security. Here are a few examples of IoT devices that have been designed with privacy in mind:</Body>
            <Header>Apple HomeKit</Header>
            <Body><strong>Apple HomeKit</strong> is a <Hyperlink href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" text="smart home platform that emphasizes privacy and security"/>. It uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that data remains secure and inaccessible to unauthorized third parties.

            <SubSection>How IoT Devices Collect and Share Data for Revenue Generation and Analytics</SubSection>
            <Body>IoT devices are capable of collecting various types of data through sensors and other sources. For example, temperature sensors can collect data on the surrounding temperature, while GPS sensors can collect location data. Cameras and microphones can also collect data, such as s, videos, and audio recordings. This data can be shared with third parties in a number of ways, including data sale, analytics, and targeted advertising. While some people may be concerned about the privacy implications of data sale, others see it as a potential source of revenue for companies. Data collected by IoT devices can also be used for analytics, allowing companies to track user behavior and identify patterns. This information can be used to improve products and services, as well as to identify new business opportunities. Additionally, data collected by IoT devices can be used for targeted advertising, providing companies with insights into user behavior, location, and preferences.</Body>
            <SubSection>Best Practices for Protecting Your Personal Data When Using IoT Devices</SubSection>
            <Body>To protect your personal data when using IoT devices, it's important to keep your devices up-to-date with the latest software and security patches. This can help prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited by hackers. Additionally, use strong and unique passwords for each of your IoT devices, and consider using a password manager to keep track of them all. Finally, consider using a VPN when accessing your IoT devices remotely to provide an additional layer of encryption and security. By following these best practices, you can help maintain your privacy and protect your personal data when using IoT devices.</Body>
            <SubSubSection>Protecting your Amazon Echo</SubSubSection>
            <Body>In 2018, a report revealed that <Hyperlink href="http://www.inderscience.com/storage/f105197114638122.pdf" text="Amazon Echo was recording and storing conversations"/> of users without their knowledge. Here are four steps to enable privacy settings on your Amazon Echo:</Body> 
            <BulletItem><strong>Mute the Microphone:</strong> The Amazon Echo is designed to always listen for the wake word, such as "Alexa" or "Echo." However, you can mute the microphone on the device to prevent it from listening. To do this, simply press the microphone off button on the device.</BulletItem>
